<!-- {{ Title: Undertaker: helping you share your projects }} -->

<h1>Undertaker</h1>

<p>Undertaker is a new-school unix utility<sup><small><a
   href="#footnote1" name="footnote1return">[1]</a></small></sup>,
  which exists to help structure your projects for release from the
  start.</p>

<p class="quote">"Ideas rot if you don't do something with them. I used to try to hoard them, 
		  but they rotted. Now I just blog them or tell people about them. Sometimes 
		  they still rot, but sometimes someone finds them useful in one way or 
		  another" -- Edd Dumbill <a href="#footnote2" name="footnote2return">[2]</a></p>

<p>The inspiration for this was a sudden realization: "Y'know, I could
put 90% of everything on my computer on the web, and it wouldn't cause
any harm."  It became abundantly clear that I wasn't publishing nearly
enough of what I was up to on the web, and that's really too bad.  So,
I started thinking about how to make sharing things on the web the
default action for my projects.  The current results of that are here,
though they are very much a work-in-progress.</p>


<p class="quote">"Publishing is like your parents coming over -- you
		  have to clean it up and make it presentable" --

		  name="footnote3return">[3]</a></p>


<p>Most of the project is still very much WIP, so the best
documentation is in the README file and the source code.  If you want
to use this right now, you'll need to be willing to do a fair bit of
hacking, kluding, and otherwise fixing up to get around the stuff I
have hard-coded for my own settings right now.</p>

<p>You can git clone the code from <a href="undertaker.git/">this
URL</a> (right-click and "copy link address").</p>

<h2>Why not use nice services like github or wordpress for
everything?</h2>

<p>There's an argument to be made for just using github (or bitbucket or
sourceforge or...) for the source code storage, and then just putting
everything up on a blog for the sharing of content.  There are a few
problems with this approach: durability, archivability, and
portability</p>

<p>"Durability" here means "How long a given publication will last."
Of all the services mentioned above, sourceforge has by far the
longest track record.  It's been up and running for over a decade at
this point.  However, for the last five years, most of us have had
serious concerns for SF's longer-term viability.  Not very many people
are putting new content up on SF, because it's not clear how much
longer they're going to be around.  Any content you put into a
closed-system service will only exist as long as that service
does.</p>

<p>"Archivability" is not a word that I just made up, I swear.  It
refers to how easy it is to create an archive of a work. There are
many people trying to create archives of the whole internet for
posterity.  The two most visible are the <a
 href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Internet Archive's Wayback
Machine</a> and <a
 href="http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Archive
Team</a>, a "loose collective of rogue archivists."  These nice people
are trying to make copies of your stuff so that people a hundred years
from now can see it.  The least we can do is make their lives easier,
by creating structures that are amenable to crawling.  We also want to
avoid running any code on the webserver: if we can publish as a big
chunk of static content, it can be archived trivially.  On the other
hand, if your site navigation is predicated on form submissions,
search boxes, and such, it becomes a part of the "<a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web">deep web</a>,"
inaccessible to crawlers and archivists.  Your site is also not
archivable by yourself: if your homepage was built using PHP3, there's
a good chance it won't run on recent PHP releases<a href="#footnote4" name="footnote4return">[4]</a>.  This means that
your carefully-crafted dynamic homepage has, effectively,
disappeared.</p>

<p>The last major concern is portability.  How much work is it to move
your project from one service to another?  If your software has its
whole homepage in github's wiki tool, and github decides to stop
supporting that feature, how hard is it going to be to move that
content off to another service?  Whatever format our final
"publication" takes, it should be trivial to move it from one service
to another.  This lines up nicely with the concerns of
"archivability."  If we publish a ball of static content, it can
easily be crawled, and it's also trivial to deploy to another
location.  You simply need to scp it to another webserver, and maybe
repoint DNS at it.</p>

<p>Undertaker is strongly informed by these three concerns.  It
attempts to be as simple as possible, both in the structure of its
ouput (a directory you can upload to literally any webserver), as well
as its input (a directory of files, following an orderly pattern).
This makes it easy for you to save copies of your work for backups and
archiving, as well as making it easy to share your work widely using
very basic, very widespread tools.  </p>

<p>It also tries to keep its processing of your input to a minimum, so
that an undertaker content repository is a decent archive itself,
without requiring anyone actually have undertaker to make sense of
it<a href="#footnote5" name="footnote5return">[5]</a>.  Locking your
information up in proprietary formats is like hiring someone to write
it all down in Navajo, Icelandic, or Esperanto.  While you're paying
her to do this, it's easy to store and retrieve your information
yourself.  But, at some point, she's going to go away.  Sure, there
are a few people around the world who will be able to get your content
out for you, but why not keep your data in a human-readable format in
the first place?</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote1">1.</a> <a href="#footnote1return">^</a> New-school unix utilities are utilities made up of subcommands.  The
  best-known examples are git and rails.  To do anything, you run 'git
  foo', and behind the scenes, git is actually just running 'git-foo'
  for you.  Your whole interface with a non-trivial world of software
  comes via one meta-command, which just multiplexes itself out to
  subcommands.  For a better description (with a fair bit of
  distraction about accounting software), see <a

  hledger</a>) <a href="#footnote1return">^return^</a> .</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote4">4.</a> <a
   href="#footnote4return">^</a> This is something I am acutely
  worried about.  The PHP3 example described comes directly from my
  experience working at <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org">ibiblio</a>,
  an internet library that provides hosting to nonprofits.  We
  <em>had</em> to upgrade to PHP4 for security reasons, after trying
  not to for years.  We set up a test server, and let all our users
   know about the pending switch.  All the maintained projects had a
   few weeks to figure out how to get their code to run under PHP4,
   and then we threw the switch.  As soon as we did, large swathes of
   information that had been available the day before was now
   disappeared from the internet.  <a
   href="#footnote4return">^return^</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote5">5.</a> <a
      href="#footnote5return">^</a> This is another example from
     personal experience.  One of my first jobs in tech was working on
     old accounting systems, helping customers upgrade to newer
     systems.  A necessary part of this is importing the old data into
     the new system. None of these systems had "export as CSV," and
     many of them were orphaned, with no company offering support.
     So, I was given a few giant blobs of data, and had to reverse
     engineer the database formats to build custom data export
     scripts.  This isn't as bad as it sounds, since most of them were
     written in COBOL, which has blissfully consistent/stupid record
     packing routines.  Better examples of "dead" file formats can be
     found at <a
