undertaker
==========

Undertaker is a project/publishing helper.  It helps you create
standardized directory structures for your projects, then helps you
put them up on the web as static websites (with clone'able git repos).
It can also help you push your code to multiple upstream git repos, so
your code can live on both your server and on github.

Usage:
======

undertake-bootstrap -- Creates your ~/projects/ directory, and
		       installs a trivial skeleton directory.

undertake-project FOO -- Creates a new project directory in
                         ~/projects/ named FOO, creates a git repo,
                         and then initializes it to your skeleton
                         project.  It does not do any commits!
